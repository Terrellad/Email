# Email

This project I was to mimic email.
So models was used to store data on users and messages sent, drafted, received, replied and archived.
Javascript handled the user interface which included highlighting if a message had not been seen and 
Python handled the storing of the data and sending of messages.
Learning how different catagories in where a message was stored whether sent, received, archived, etc. was challenging.
As well as understanding how Javascript and Python work together to achieve the programs goal.
